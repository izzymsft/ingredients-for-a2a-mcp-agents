# Ingredients for Building A2A and MCP Powered Agents in Production
This is an outline for talk on designing and building effective agents powered by MCP and A2A on Azure

## Background
AI agents are gradually becoming the preferred and desired user experience for interacting with applications today. There are currently two internet standards today that are driving the design and implementations of agentic systems (MCP and A2A). This presentation focuses on the pillars of designing, building, deploying and maintaining secure, scalable, reliable and effective agents in production on Microsoft Azure.

We cover the 9 principles and pillars that drive effective agent architectures as well as the 3 core ingredients that enable you to design intelligent systems using the two internet standards (A2A and MCP)

## 9 Key Pillars for Effective Agents
These pillars are fundamental to the design of effective AI agents in production:
- User-Centric Design
- Security
- Data Quality
- Scalable Data Pipelines
- Tool-Calling Architecture
- Multi-Agent Collaboration
- LLM Selection
- Memory Design & Management
- Reflection & Validation

## 2 Foundational Protocols and Support These Pillars
In this segment, we introduce the audience to the two protocols, why they matter and how they are leveraged by AI agents to solve problems.

- MCP: providing AI agents with access to tools, resources and capabilities
- A2A: providing distributed agents with the ability to collaborate to accomplish specific goals.


## The 3 Most Important Ingredients that Power A2A and MCP on Azure
Here we cover various categories of data stores, infrastructure and services that are necessary for building these agentic systems with A2A and MCP.
- Data stores
- Infrastructure
- AI Services
